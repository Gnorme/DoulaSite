              As a doula and childbirth educator, it brings me immense joy to
              provide support to pregnant individuals and their families in the
              Montreal area, guiding them through the transformative journey
              from pregnancy to parenthood. Since 2015, I have had the privilege
              of working with numerous families in Montreal and Ontario serving
              as their Birth and Postpartum Doula. With extensive experience and
              a wide range of practical skills in pregnancy and childbirth, I
              approach each role with wisdom, passion, and mindfulness.

              professionals in different settings. I am dedicated to supporting
              your choices and adapting to the specific needs of your birth,
              serving as a respectful and integral member of your team.

              My role is to accompany you along the way providing loving
              guidance, gentle suggestions, and my firm belief in a womanâ€™s

              Doula services provide continuous emotional, physical, and
              informational support throughout pregnancy, labour, and
              postpartum. Doulas advocate for the birthing person's preferences,
              offer comfort measures during labour, provide evidence-based
              information, and assist with postpartum care, which includes but
              is not limited to, sibling care, breastfeeding support, nutrition
              and anything the parents need to feel comfortable and confident.
              As your doula, I am here to be your personal resource throughout
              your pregnancy and the initial weeks postpartum.

                    Once you have chosen to hire me as your doula, I find it
                    important to meet with you in the comfort of your own home
                    for two sessions, each lasting approximately two hours.
                    During these visits, we will take the time to get to know
                    each other better, discuss important information, and
                    explore various options to help you prepare for labour and
                    the arrival of your baby. We will also practice relaxation
                    techniques, comfort measures, and different labour
                    positions. I strongly encourage the involvement of your
                    partner or anyone else who will be present during your
                    birth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starting from the 37th week of your pregnancy, I consider
                    myself on call 24/7 to support you during your birth. My
                    objective is to help you feel relaxed and confident
                    throughout the process, so it is important for us to stay in
                    touch regularly during this stage. Once you feel the need
                    for additional labour support, I will join you and remain by
                    your side until your baby is born and you are settled.
                    Typically, I stay for 1-3 hours after the birth. During this
                    time, I provide both physical and emotional care and
                    support. I also ensure that your partner feels included by
                    offering suggestions and encouraging their participation
                    according to their comfort level. After the birth, my doula
                    services include immediate breastfeeding support and
                    assisting you and your family in settling in and preparing
                    for rest.

                  <p>
                    Over the course of 1 - 2 postpartum visits I will help
                    ensure that breastfeeding is going smoothly and that your
                    recovery is progressing well. I am available to answer any
                    questions you may have about being a new parent and can
                    connect you with local resources within your community. In
                    addition to emotional support, I will provide practical
                    assistance such as baby care, cooking, and light household
                    chores. These visits also allow us to reflect on our
                    experience together and look forward to future updates on
                    your progress. I am here as a resource for you throughout
                    your parenting and breastfeeding journey.
